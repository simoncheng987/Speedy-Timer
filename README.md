# Speedy-Timer



## Intro:

Speedy Timer is an "app" which uses 100% of batch files to realize the function of a basic timer.

The timer will be run inside the comman prompt window.



## Feature:

personality think this is better than the windows default timer, since it is easy and straightfoward.

When you are trying to study/work, the GUI can just be a distract to your attention.

For example, the default microsoft timer

You have to create one timer by multiple clikcing its graphical interface before actually use. In my one, you open and use hence minimize the distrcation from the software itself. The black background command prompt is low-key and minimal, you just need to type in some digits and enter. That's it.

This app keeps the simlicity of a timer, for people who uses pomodoro techniques, it can be the best tool (at least I think it that way)



## How to use:

There are two ".bat" file can be executed:

1. timer_app_sec.bat 
2. timer_app_min.bat

The first one will count down will have unit in **seconds**. If you type in "130", it will count down from 130 seconds.

The second one will count down will have unit in **minutes**. If you type in "130", it will count down from 130 minutes.

If you enter 0 or any integers less than that, then it will terminate.

Otherwise, the program will continue to run.

The program will shut the alarm up when it exits, however if the alarm still remains. There is also a shut_up.bat program you can run to manually shut down the alarm.



## Customize

To customize the timer, you can replace the alarm.mp3 file within the sound folder to any music you like. Make sure you rename it to alarm.mp3 after the replacement.
